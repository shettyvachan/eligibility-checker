# 📜 Legal Rule-Based Eligibility Checker

This project is a simple rule-based eligibility checker using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Prolog**.

It demonstrates how you can combine logical rules (written in Prolog) with a web app interface (built with Streamlit) to evaluate legal eligibility, such as for a simplified work visa application.
